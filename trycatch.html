<h1>Try-Catch-Finally</h1>
<div id = "theory">In Java, the try-catch-finally block is used to handle exceptions in a program. The try block contains the code that might generate an exception, while the catch block contains the code that handles the exception if one occurs. Finally block is used to execute code that should always be executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.

    In the try block, the code that might throw an exception is enclosed. If an exception is thrown, the control is transferred to the catch block. The catch block contains the code that handles the exception. If no exception is thrown, the catch block is skipped.

    The finally block is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. This block is used to close resources that were opened in the try block, like file streams, database connections, and network sockets.

    The try-catch-finally block provides a robust mechanism for handling exceptions in Java programs. It helps in preventing the program from crashing due to unexpected errors, and also makes it easier to debug the program by providing detailed error messages.</div>
